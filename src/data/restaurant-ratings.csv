The Folks (Lisbon),80,"Very good presentation of food and nice vibe. Wish we could have swapped the choice of bread free of charge however.",01-01-2024
Azzurra (London),60,"It was ok, but very overpriced and gimicky. £39 for some spaghetti and a single prawn. £20 for some sorbet mixed with Prosecco and sold as a fancy 'cocktail'. And a £15 Tiramisu made at the table just for show. We were disappointed to not be allowed to take the leftover food home in a box.",01-01-2024

Marè (Lagos),80,"A nice and affordable buffet for meat lovers in particular",01-01-2024
Wingmans (London),85,"Very good Buffalo wings. Loaded Salt N Peppa Tots side not so good. 2 cocktails took atleast 15 mins to arrive.",01-01-2024
Cattleya (London),80,"Nice, authentic Thai food. Impressive service from the single lady who was running the restaurant. Main tasted good but the noodles were stuck together. Starters were also good but would have expected some dips to be provided.",01-01-2024
Tharavadu (Leeds),60,"Tasty food, but the miniscule portions were very disappointing. 3 prawns in a starter that cost almost £10 was a bit of a joke.",01-01-2024
Som Saa (London),65,"A unique Thai menu, albeit quite limited. Spicier than I was expecting. The cured prawns starter was literally completely raw prawns with the slightest hint of flavour.",01-01-2024
Trattoria Isolana (Turks & Caicos),65,"Not bad but the Chicken Escalope was a bit basic.",01-01-2024
Provence By Eric (Turks & Caicos),70,"A bit pretentious overall. Mains were decent. 'Burrata' starter was a bit of a joke. Chefs table experience was cool, but wish the chefs made more of an effort to speak to us, rather than only speaking to the guests who could speak French.",01-01-2024
Seven (Turks & Caicos),70,"Nice chorizo Paella. Outdated decor and lots of empty tables brought down the ambience.",01-01-2024

Indigo (Turks & Caicos),85,"Very good food. Appreciated that the head chef came to speak to us.",01-01-2024

Mercer Roof Terrace (London),90,"An exceptional Christmas meal. Well presented and tasty food. Good service and friendly staff.",05-12-2024
SMOKESTAK (London),80,"Tasty brisket bun. Quite cramped space wise indoors, but they accomodated a walk-in without reservation during peak-hours which was nice.",10-12-2024
Devonshire Terrace by Drake & Morgan (London),70,"Decent Christmas meal. Good braised ox-cheek.",11-12-2024
Flat Iron (Leeds),90,"Great steak and very reasonable prices. The free popcorn and ice cream were nice touches. Should add Chimmichuri to the menu.",31-12-2024
Osteria Romana (London),80,"Good authentic Italian food and big portion sizes. The carbonara was a little too salty (but that is somewhat to be expected with Guanciale based dishes). Reasonable prices given the Knightsbridge location. Complimentary Tiramisu dessert for our birthday celebration was a nice touch.",18-01-2025
Sushi & Momo Zone (London),75,"Decent Sushi at affordable prices. Atmosphere/ambience was a little too quiet.",14-02-2025
Ambassadors Clubhouse (London),65,"Decent, but overall quality of food not quite up to the standard of other JK restaurants such as Trishna. The curry was way too spicy with no option for a lower spice level. Cheeky to charge £4 for raita which were offered to help with the spice and we assumed would be complimentary. Good portion sizes and lovely gulabjaman dessert. A great old fashioned cocktail. Nice decor & vibe.",25-04-2025
Trattoria Da Denis (Venice),80,"An excellent carbonara with al dente spaghetti and the perfect creamy sauce. Panchetta was too thin however.",13-06-2025
Bo Osteria (Venice),60,"Cute small restaurant with a chill vibe. However, I wasn't blown away by the gnocchi, was expecting actual pieces of Panchetta rather than grated flakes.",13-06-2025
Al Peoceto Risorto (Venice),70,"Lasagne was decent but the pasta sheets could have been more al dente and the cheese on top more crispy. Nice cocktails and vibe.",14-06-2025
Dal Moro's (Venice),60,"The carbonara cheese wheel was more for show and not authentic or particularly tasty. The cheese from the wheel was barely melted, so didn't result in an emulsified and creamy sauce. The chunky panchetta pieces were nice however. The chicken Caesar salad used cheap chunks of processed chicken and was too saucy for our liking. Generous sized cocktails. Cheeky to ask for 'optional' service charge, which felt too awkward to refuse, when table cover charge had already been added.",14-06-2025
La Piazzetta (Dolomites),75,"Nice thin crust pizza with a unique hemp-based dough.",15-06-2025
Ristorante Amadeus (Dolomites),70,"Good service. Nice Venison Ragu. Sole fish was nice, but quite cheeky to serve this completely on its own so we had to order potatoes and vegetables separately.",15-06-2025
Bar Chalet (Dolomites),40,"Not the most helpful staff when it came to explaining menu items. Just a basic fast food spot at a popular tourist spot, so expectations weren't particularly high.",16-06-2025
Ristorante Pizzeria 5 Torri (Dolomites),70,"Fast service and good portion sizes. Decent carbonara, but almost a bit too saucy and the Panchetta was thin and scarce.",16-06-2025
Pizzeria Edelweiss (Dolomites),85,"Nice pizza and very reasonable prices. Enjoyed the coke on draught, which is not often seen around Italy.",17-06-2025
II Vizietto Di Cortina (Dolomites),70,"Great service with unique complimentary gifts including a Ricotta & Jam starter and serving of Limoncello. The carbonara was authentic with it's use of guanciale, but I personally find this to be way too salty. The spaghetti on the other hand was a bit bland and unsalted, and the eggs had started to scramble slightly. Purple gnocchi was nice.",17-06-2025
Thai Corner (Manchester),75,"Decent currys which pack a good level of heat.",20-06-2025
Fatpats (Manchester),80,"Very tasty subs. Spenny but the sizeable subs are good for 2 meals to be fair.",21-06-2025
Sri Non Thai (Leeds),75,"Good authentic Thai food. However, quite slow service and decor could do with some work.",21-06-2025
The Old Original Bakewell Pudding Shop (Bakewell),85,"Was worried this place would be a bit of a tourist trap but it was actually surprisingly good. The open steak sandwich was great, and of course yummy Bakewell pudding and tarts too.",19-07-2025
Lovage by Lee Smith (Bakewell),90,"A high quality and well presented tasting menu.",19-07-2025
Ad Maiora (Manchester),75,"An authentic Italian sandwich shop serving fresh schiacciata. The Haaland and Inferno were both great, with their own unique flavour profiles. Could do with more seating and our table hadn't been cleaned.",09-08-2025
Madre (Manchester),85,"Tasty Mexican Tapas with great atmosphere and decor. Loved the Birria tacos and crispy fried potatoes in particular.",09-08-2025
Gooey (Manchester),75,"The french toast and cinnamon bun were excellent, accompanied by nice and fresh cold pressed juices. The 20 mins queue wasn't ideal and the decor and seating could be improved however.",09-08-
Caru' cu bere (Bucharest),75,"Amazing indoor decor and decent food.",05-09-2025
The Mango Tree (Bucharest),85,"Nice classy restaurant with good food at reasonable prices. Nonthaburi duck could have had a bit more of a heat kick to it.",05-09-2025
Mayfair 39 (Bucharest),90,"An 'Instagrammable' brunch spot with surprisingly good food. The pistachio fluffy pancakes were excellent and the crème sauce wasn't too thick nor sickly, as is often the case with desserts involving nut spreads.",06-09-2025
Cabana Paltinu (Transfăgărășan),60,"Cute lodge vibes, but food was pretty average, and wine was poor.",06-09-2025
Cyurly-Burly (Transfăgărășan),70,"A nice little find in a remote mountainous region, with friendly and humourous staff. A large authentic smoker prepares meat for over 10 hours. The beef brisket was decent, although a bit dry, and the fries were a bit oily and soggy. Also, the frappuccino didn't seem to contain blended ice.",07-09-2025
The Brunch House (Brasov),75,"A decent brunch spot, although I would argue a bit overrated. The Pistachio crème used in the Latte and Waffles was too thick and sickly. The star of the show was the spiced Romanian sausage (similar to Chorizo), and the side potatoes were tasty too. Unfortunately there wasn't much of a vibe in the upstairs room in which we were seated.",08-09-2025
Onda (Manchester),90,"A spacious and well presented restaurant with very nice staff. A great selection of pastas and pizzettas, with the Beef Shin Ragu Mafaldine being the standout dish for me. Good affogato, with the authentic diamond-hole shaped gelato. Caffe Latte was too small.",12-10-2025
Alfi (London),80,"A nice authentic carbonara, with al dente pasta, a perfect creamy sauce, and strips of guanciale which surprisingly wasn't too salty. Tiramisu was scooped generously tableside for us, but the ladyfinger layers were inconsistent in their soaking of espresso, with some parts a lot stronger than others.",21-10-2025
