Poor Things,80,"Generally loved the style and direction and was very funny, although the sex scenes got a bit excessive and felt some bits were just weird for the sake of it without actually contributing to character development or story."
Godzilla Minus One,70,"Overall decent, and better storyline than the Hollywood ones, although I found the actual Godzilla creature a bit underwhelming. The bit where the plane flies into it's mouth but doesn't explode for a few seconds was very strange."
Society of the Snow,90,"Very good. No corners were cut with cheap sets/CGI, the film was shot at the actual location of the real crash. It also didn't shy away from showing the gory details, so we fully appreciate what they went through."
Maestro,60,"Not bad but also not particularly interesting. There was potential to explore some deep themes such as being Jewish and homosexual in the 1940s, but neither were really delved into. While the film lacks substance it does however contain strong performances from the lead actor/actress, especially Carey Mulligan, both worthy of their Oscar nominations."
Dark Waters,70,"An eye-opening true story. I liked how some people from the real case appeared in the movie. Although I think some focus should have been shifted away from the trial and more time given to showing victims and how the chemicals affected their lives, to emotionally engage the viewer more."
Saltburn,60,"The cinematography was beautiful, shot in 35mm it has a distinct look from its saturation and contrast. However, the movie is let down by a farfetched plot with many holes. In the end we’re left feeling unfulfilled and lacking an understanding of Oliver’s motivations, was it money, jealousy, or spitefulness?"
Killers of the Flower Moon,80,"Stellar performances from Dicaprio and DeNiro, as always. Classic Scorsese themes while exploring an era/culture not often portrayed in Hollywood. Wasn’t a fan of the musical score and felt it detracted from the seriousness of some of the scenes. It was surprisingly engaging for a 3.5 hour long film, but still, films this long should not be a thing."
About My Father,40,"Painfully predictable. Cheesy but a few laughs nonetheless."
Anatomy of a Fall,75,"An interesting twist on the classic murder mystery genre, but with only 1 suspect in this case. Phenomenal acting from all the cast. There’s a major feeling of frustration after watching this movie, as in the end there’s no explanation or twist and we don’t know how to feel about Sandra."
The Iron Claw,80,"An unbelievably depressing true story. Overall very good but a bit slow in parts. Despite the extensive tragedies this story contains, there were no real tear-jerker moments, due to a lack of deep dialogue and missing emotion portrayed in the characters in some pivotal moments."
The Zone of Interest,50,"Disappointing for a film with such potential. The idea was strong, to show the contrast between a concentration camp and those who live on the other side. But although we already have some understanding of the atrocities that occurred inside the camps, the viewer is never shown any of this and thus little emotion is evoked. We are left watching the mundane day-to-day lives of a household."
Nyad,70,"An incredibly inspiring true story. We never really feel like we’re fully rooting for the protagonist to succeed as she’s extremely selfish and only wants what’s best for her."
99 Homes,70,"A good story of moral dilemmas and some interesting lessons about the U.S. housing crisis. Good performances from Andrew Garfield and Michael Shannon, but mediocre for the rest of the cast. Decent overall but no particularly stand out moments."
Gerald's Game,40,"Usually a big fan of Stephen King adaptations, but this one falls short in so many ways. Having not read the book myself, I can’t completely comment in which ways the book and the film are to blame separately. There were some tense/scary moments, but all of these seemed to be cut short and momentum was lost. Having Jessie hallucinating after a mere half a day was just ludicrous. Some decent artistic shots involving the flashbacks was this film’s only saving grace."
Defiance,65,"A different perspective on the holocaust than we are usually shown in films. We are shown the story of those who were able to fight back despite their difficult situation. Decent overall, nothing particularly amazing though."
Dune: Part Two,85,"A lot better than the first instalment in many ways. A much more engaging and action-packed storyline. Visually stunning cinematography from Villeneuve, as usual. Great character played by Austin Butler, much smaller than his brother in stature and build, but somehow more intimidating and villainous. Some things didn’t really make sense though, like why does everyone fight with swords when they have access to guns and other technologically advanced weaponry, but I guess sword fights make for better action scenes."
The Aviator,65,"Started very strong but really started to drag in the 2nd half. Perhaps the only film I’ve seen to depict struggles with OCD and it was interesting to see his deterioration throughout the film. At first I found the colour grading very jarring and over-the-top, but later discovered it was intentionally used to emulate the technicolor film stock that was used during that period, which in hindsight was a clever and unique technique. Although relevant to tell Hugh’s story, I found the lawsuit related sections quite dull."
The Elephant Man,80,"A sad but also uplifting film as we see Joseph Merrick make the most of his difficult life, with a touching ending. Very impressive makeup and visual effects for a film from 1980."
The Meg 2,30,"Poor script, bad acting, and a ridiculous plot...I expected nothing less."
Filth,65,"An unsettling watch. We somehow feel both disdain and sympathy for the protagonist. The script is so unusal and spoken in thick accents that it's quite difficult to follow the dialogue and sub-plots in this film."
Call Me by Your Name,60,"An extremely slow-burner. A lot of empty scenes and dialogue which don't make much sense. However, I did like the choice of location, era and music."
Past Lives,75,"A simple storyline, beautifully shot on 35mm. Exceptional acting from all, but we grow to dislike Nora’s character (unapologetically abandoning Hae and her utter disregard for Arthur’s feelings are just a couple reasons), and so it’s hard to feel any sympathy for her."
The Favourite,50,"Not much really happens and just simply quite dull overall."
Infernal Affairs,40,"Quite difficult to follow, partly because of fast subtitles. Not particularly entertaining either."
Aftersun,40,"Painfully slow and uneventful. A decent deeper story which isn’t too in your face, but also not really delved into enough for us to truly understand the characters’ emotions."
Belfast,55,"Alright, but not much happened."
My Friend Dahmer,30,"Not what I expected, the film focusses on Dahmer’s teenage years only, which makes for a pretty mundane story. Dahmer was portrayed to be overly eccentric and confident, which doesn’t seem factually accurate."
Triangle of Sadness,55,"Started quite strong with a storyline touching on wealth & power inequalities. However, some sections of the plot didn’t seem to go anywhere, nor were they explained, such as the aftermath of the Captain’s dinner."
Swiss Army Man,50,"One of the most unique and bizarre films I’ve ever seen. A lot of gags were painfully overused, such as the flatulence and erections. The role of playing a lifeless, emotionless dead body seemed perfect for Daniel Radcliffe, but he somehow managed to under deliver yet again."
Where the Crawdads Sing,75,"Pretty decent overall. A sad backstory makes us understanding of Daisy’s deep fear of abandonment and how she ultimately allows a bad person in her life. Would’ve preferred a bit more focus on the actual crime, rather than just the romantic elements. Not sure why an impoverished 'swamp girl' is shown to be wearing a full-face of makeup in every scene."
500 Days of Summer,60,"Some artistic scenes in places and a unique portrayal of the story timeline, but otherwise nothing special. Zooey Deschanel again finds herself playing a character (Summer) which isn’t entirely likeable, and it’s hard to understand why Tom is so obsessed with her. It’s also not really clear why their relationship deteriorated. The revelation of Summer’s big news towards the end of the movie is really difficult to understand and not fitting with the character that has been developed throughout the movie."
Tracks,40,"(Spoilers) Disappointing in so many ways. The real story may be awe-inspiring, but this isn’t well reflected in the movie and no major challenges are depicted. Robyn contradicts herself throughout the movie, by insisting she must complete the trek all by herself, yet accepts various forms of help, such as water tanks being left along the route for her. The scene with the wild charging bulls fails to carry any intensity as they are shown from a great distance away and even slow down considerably, yet for some reason they are still put down by Robyn. A painfully predictable romance ensues with her photographer, which was short lived and seemed to begin and end rather abruptly."
Inside Story,50,"Obviously quite a low budget film, with pretty poor acting all around and very questionable documentary-like CGI. Still a somewhat feel-good movie and worth a watch if you have some time to kill."
Dogtooth,45,"(Spoliers) As is the case with most Yorgos films, more style than substance. No explanation is given as to the motivations of the parent’s strict upbringing of their children. It’s also not really clear why the Dad arranges sexual experiences for his son, who seems to partake in it more out of routine than his own pleasure, and it gets even stranger when these encounters become incestuous."
Bernie,55,"Alright, but not a particularly spectacular story to be made into a movie."
The Outfit,60,"Decent first half, but storyline becomes farfetched and overly-complicated."
Deathproof,85,"A slowburner but very good nonetheless. One of the only films I've seen with realistic and easy-to-follow dialogue. Classic Tarantino themes of extreme gore and an obsession with feet."
Jacob's Ladder,75,"A pretty good psychological thriller where we constantly question what is reality and whether we should believe and sympathise with Jacob’s claims. However, quite a disappointing and cliche ending where the various layers of the story that unfolded now all seem rather pointless."
71,60,"Was excited to see another Jack O’Connell film after his impressive role in “Unbroken”, however here he was cast into a role involving very little dialogue or opportunities to deliver a notable performance. Decent overall, but was quite confused as to who was on what side. Some tense moments which seemed to lose momentum or end rather prematurely."
The Black Phone,55,"Started relatively strong but soon got a bit ridiculous. Although this film is a horror and supernatural elements are to be expected, it felt like it didn’t actually need them and could have just played with the serial killer storyline. There was also no attempt at explaining the whole black phone situation."
Jurassic World: Dominion,40,"Quite painful to watch. The same plot being recycled over and over again. This film’s only saving grace was that it seemed to have less CGI and more real-world models than the other Jurassic World films. This series really needs to end, it’s painful to know another one is on the way."
Kiss The Girls,55,"Started decent but got a bit farfetched. Quite a predictable twist at the end too."
Carrie,60,"Quite bizarre. It seemed most of the film was just a build up to an extreme finale. Was a bit confused with the ending and lack of resolution."
Demolition Man,60,"Good use of sets rather than dated CGI. Wesley Snipes makes a great bad guy. Bit confused why references to John’s daughter are included in the plot yet no attempts to identify her are made."
The World's Fastest Indian,60,"An easy watch and a feel-good film for all ages. There’s not many serious twists or turns however, and the constant repeating of questions due to Burt’s hearing problems quickly becomes infuriating."
It Ends With Us,75,"A unique take on the Romance genre, with some deeper topics explored. Not without its fair share of cliche/cheesy moments though."
Mulholland Drive,70,"Understood the overall storyline of the movie but there were lots of scenes and details that don’t really seem to have any explanation or relevance. The over-the-top, almost theatre-like, acting works well to give you the feeling something isn’t quite right."
A History of Violence,60,"Had potential but the backstory and Tom’s past life wasn’t really explored at all."
Legends of the Fall,50,"A strange and complicated love story. In the end we don’t have much respect for the two main protagonists, Tristan and Susannah, given their questionable behaviour and choices throughout."
Alien: Romulus,80,"(SPOILERS) A strong addition to the series. The facehugger and chest-bursting scenes are staples to the series but can feel a bit repetitive after a while. The new alien creature and style of main characters added some originality to this instalment. Could have done with some more planetary locations, rather than all the action taking place on the spaceship."
The Mule,70,"Decent, enjoyable performance from Clint Eastwood. Hard to believe Earl didn’t understand for so long what he was carrying. In the end we don’t feel any sympathy for Earl as its never really explained why he was absent in his families lives for so many years."
Fatal Attraction,75,"An intense thriller with a believable and well executed plot. Great performances all round."
The Thin Red Line,70,"Nice cinematography and realistic action scenes in this star-studded war film. The runtime could have been a lot shorter, with the middle half dragging on for quite a while. Also, the narration was a bit too abstract and didn’t make much sense."
The Greatest Of All Time,50,"A farfetched plot and over the top action scenes, but as to be expected for any Tamil movie. Quite a unique storyline and twist, although the post-credits scene was a bit silly."
Fracture,65,"(SPOILERS) The film revolves around an elaborate cover up of a murder, but in the end its all unraveled by some simple technicalities in the “Double Jeopardy” law, which is hard to believe Mr. Crawford overlooked. The cliffhanger ending leaves us beyond frustrated and makes the entire film seem a bit pointless. Poor performance from Rosamund Pike, but made up for by Gosling and Hopkins."
Juno,70,"Decent, but Juno is quite intolerable and its hard to understand why Mark & Vanessa would trust her."
Back To Black,70,"An insightful dive into the chaotic life of the late Amy Winehouse. While honouring her legacy and talents, the film also doesn’t shy away from showing her negative sides too."
Sleepers,80,"A unique and interesting story. However, was expecting a plot twist or some drama caused by the love triangle."
Money Monster,50,"(SPOILERS) Such a far fetched and unrealistic plot. Lee was essentially allowed to attempt market manipulation live on TV, without any repercussions, by asking viewers to invest in IBIS under the pretence that it might save his life, even though Kyle already expressed he wasn’t interested in the money. Infact, we’re frustratingly left not knowing Kyle’s full motivations for his acts for most of the movie, until he finally reveals he simply wanted an apology from Walt, which is just bizarre and child-like. The film tries to garner sympathy for Kyle in the end, although it fails to really do so as ultimately he made his own investment decisions and also almost kills a man unnecessarily."
Will & Harper,40,"The odd touching moment, but otherwise pretty boring."
Blink Twice,75,"(SPOLIERS) A gripping psychological thriller with well built-up suspense throughout. Not without some major plot holes and unanswered questions though. For example, why does the perfume only erase Jess from the other girls’ memories, yet they can perfectly remember eachother. Also it’s never explained why Slater was apologising at the start of the movie and what he had done."
Step Up,60,"A feel-good and easy to watch film, albeit very cheesy and predictable. Impressive dancing all round."
Woman of the Hour,75,"A commendable directorial debut from Anna Kendrick. Straight and to the point, with minimal unnecessary fluff. Could have done with a bit more backstory on Rodney, as reading up later revealed a lot of interesting history."
Don’t Move,20,"Terrible plot. Terrible acting. Terrible script. Just truly terrible all round."
Midsommar,65,"(SPOILERS) Didn’t quite live up to its potential. Very slow and drawn out, with too many parts that just don’t add up. Soon after arriving Dani is adamant she wants to leave, but then for some reason this is never shown again and she stays willingly. Dani has a bad trip from the mushroom tea, but then bizarrely decides to take it again (or some similar psycoactive drink) later for the May queen dance competition. A huge deal is made of the fact that Simon left for the train station without Connie, yet barely an eyelid is bat when both Mark and Josh disappear in the same day."
Heretic,65,"(SPOILERS) Decent, but nothing special. Starts well, with lots of well-built tension, but soon loses momentum with drawn out monologues. Too much focus on the religious elements, where the psychopathic/serial-killer themes would have been more engaging. Hugh Grant excelled in what was a very different role to his norm."
The Master,55,"This film lacks an engaging storyline or sense of direction. Nothing really happens and there’s several mind-numbingly boring sequences. Somewhat rescued by its beautiful cinematography and excellent performances all round."
