Poor Things,80,"Generally loved the style and direction and was very funny, although the sex scenes got a bit excessive and felt some bits were just weird for the sake of it without actually contributing to character development or story.",01-01-2024
Godzilla Minus One,70,"Overall decent, and better storyline than the Hollywood ones, although I found the actual Godzilla creature a bit underwhelming. The bit where the plane flies into it's mouth but doesn't explode for a few seconds was very strange.",01-01-2024
Society of the Snow,90,"Very good. No corners were cut with cheap sets/CGI, the film was shot at the actual location of the real crash. It also didn't shy away from showing the gory details, so we fully appreciate what they went through.",01-01-2024
Maestro,60,"Not bad but also not particularly interesting. There was potential to explore some deep themes such as being Jewish and homosexual in the 1940s, but neither were really delved into. While the film lacks substance it does however contain strong performances from the lead actor/actress, especially Carey Mulligan, both worthy of their Oscar nominations.",01-01-2024
Dark Waters,70,"An eye-opening true story. I liked how some people from the real case appeared in the movie. Although I think some focus should have been shifted away from the trial and more time given to showing victims and how the chemicals affected their lives, to emotionally engage the viewer more.",01-01-2024
Saltburn,60,"The cinematography was beautiful, shot in 35mm it has a distinct look from its saturation and contrast. However, the movie is let down by a farfetched plot with many holes. In the end we’re left feeling unfulfilled and lacking an understanding of Oliver’s motivations, was it money, jealousy, or spitefulness?",01-01-2024
Killers of the Flower Moon,80,"Stellar performances from Dicaprio and DeNiro, as always. Classic Scorsese themes while exploring an era/culture not often portrayed in Hollywood. Wasn’t a fan of the musical score and felt it detracted from the seriousness of some of the scenes. It was surprisingly engaging for a 3.5 hour long film, but still, films this long should not be a thing.",01-01-2024
About My Father,40,"Painfully predictable. Cheesy but a few laughs nonetheless.",01-01-2024
Anatomy of a Fall,75,"An interesting twist on the classic murder mystery genre, but with only 1 suspect in this case. Phenomenal acting from all the cast. There’s a major feeling of frustration after watching this movie, as in the end there’s no explanation or twist and we don’t know how to feel about Sandra.",01-01-2024
The Iron Claw,80,"An unbelievably depressing true story. Overall very good but a bit slow in parts. Despite the extensive tragedies this story contains, there were no real tear-jerker moments, due to a lack of deep dialogue and missing emotion portrayed in the characters in some pivotal moments.",01-01-2024
The Zone of Interest,50,"Disappointing for a film with such potential. The idea was strong, to show the contrast between a concentration camp and those who live on the other side. But although we already have some understanding of the atrocities that occurred inside the camps, the viewer is never shown any of this and thus little emotion is evoked. We are left watching the mundane day-to-day lives of a household.",01-01-2024
Nyad,70,"An incredibly inspiring true story. We never really feel like we’re fully rooting for the protagonist to succeed as she’s extremely selfish and only wants what’s best for her.",01-01-2024
99 Homes,70,"A good story of moral dilemmas and some interesting lessons about the U.S. housing crisis. Good performances from Andrew Garfield and Michael Shannon, but mediocre for the rest of the cast. Decent overall but no particularly stand out moments.",01-01-2024
Gerald's Game,40,"Usually a big fan of Stephen King adaptations, but this one falls short in so many ways. Having not read the book myself, I can’t completely comment in which ways the book and the film are to blame separately. There were some tense/scary moments, but all of these seemed to be cut short and momentum was lost. Having Jessie hallucinating after a mere half a day was just ludicrous. Some decent artistic shots involving the flashbacks was this film’s only saving grace.",01-01-2024
Defiance,65,"A different perspective on the holocaust than we are usually shown in films. We are shown the story of those who were able to fight back despite their difficult situation. Decent overall, nothing particularly amazing though.",01-01-2024
Dune: Part Two,85,"A lot better than the first instalment in many ways. A much more engaging and action-packed storyline. Visually stunning cinematography from Villeneuve, as usual. Great character played by Austin Butler, much smaller than his brother in stature and build, but somehow more intimidating and villainous. Some things didn’t really make sense though, like why does everyone fight with swords when they have access to guns and other technologically advanced weaponry, but I guess sword fights make for better action scenes.",01-01-2024
The Aviator,65,"Started very strong but really started to drag in the 2nd half. Perhaps the only film I’ve seen to depict struggles with OCD and it was interesting to see his deterioration throughout the film. At first I found the colour grading very jarring and over-the-top, but later discovered it was intentionally used to emulate the technicolor film stock that was used during that period, which in hindsight was a clever and unique technique. Although relevant to tell Hugh’s story, I found the lawsuit related sections quite dull.",01-01-2024
The Elephant Man,80,"A sad but also uplifting film as we see Joseph Merrick make the most of his difficult life, with a touching ending. Very impressive makeup and visual effects for a film from 1980.",01-01-2024
The Meg 2,30,"Poor script, bad acting, and a ridiculous plot...I expected nothing less.",01-01-2024
Filth,65,"An unsettling watch. We somehow feel both disdain and sympathy for the protagonist. The script is so unusal and spoken in thick accents that it's quite difficult to follow the dialogue and sub-plots in this film.",01-01-2024
Call Me by Your Name,60,"An extremely slow-burner. A lot of empty scenes and dialogue which don't make much sense. However, I did like the choice of location, era and music.",01-01-2024
Past Lives,75,"A simple storyline, beautifully shot on 35mm. Exceptional acting from all, but we grow to dislike Nora’s character (unapologetically abandoning Hae and her utter disregard for Arthur’s feelings are just a couple reasons), and so it’s hard to feel any sympathy for her.",01-01-2024
The Favourite,50,"Not much really happens and just simply quite dull overall.",01-01-2024
Infernal Affairs,40,"Quite difficult to follow, partly because of fast subtitles. Not particularly entertaining either.",01-01-2024
Aftersun,40,"Painfully slow and uneventful. A decent deeper story which isn’t too in your face, but also not really delved into enough for us to truly understand the characters’ emotions.",01-01-2024
Belfast,55,"Alright, but not much happened.",01-01-2024
My Friend Dahmer,30,"Not what I expected, the film focusses on Dahmer’s teenage years only, which makes for a pretty mundane story. Dahmer was portrayed to be overly eccentric and confident, which doesn’t seem factually accurate.",01-01-2024
Triangle of Sadness,55,"Started quite strong with a storyline touching on wealth & power inequalities. However, some sections of the plot didn’t seem to go anywhere, nor were they explained, such as the aftermath of the Captain’s dinner.",01-01-2024
Swiss Army Man,50,"One of the most unique and bizarre films I’ve ever seen. A lot of gags were painfully overused, such as the flatulence and erections. The role of playing a lifeless, emotionless dead body seemed perfect for Daniel Radcliffe, but he somehow managed to under deliver yet again.",01-01-2024
Where the Crawdads Sing,75,"Pretty decent overall. A sad backstory makes us understanding of Daisy’s deep fear of abandonment and how she ultimately allows a bad person in her life. Would’ve preferred a bit more focus on the actual crime, rather than just the romantic elements. Not sure why an impoverished 'swamp girl' is shown to be wearing a full-face of makeup in every scene.",01-01-2024
500 Days of Summer,60,"Some artistic scenes in places and a unique portrayal of the story timeline, but otherwise nothing special. Zooey Deschanel again finds herself playing a character (Summer) which isn’t entirely likeable, and it’s hard to understand why Tom is so obsessed with her. It’s also not really clear why their relationship deteriorated. The revelation of Summer’s big news towards the end of the movie is really difficult to understand and not fitting with the character that has been developed throughout the movie.",01-01-2024
Tracks,40,"(Spoilers) Disappointing in so many ways. The real story may be awe-inspiring, but this isn’t well reflected in the movie and no major challenges are depicted. Robyn contradicts herself throughout the movie, by insisting she must complete the trek all by herself, yet accepts various forms of help, such as water tanks being left along the route for her. The scene with the wild charging bulls fails to carry any intensity as they are shown from a great distance away and even slow down considerably, yet for some reason they are still put down by Robyn. A painfully predictable romance ensues with her photographer, which was short lived and seemed to begin and end rather abruptly.",01-01-2024
Inside Story,50,"Obviously quite a low budget film, with pretty poor acting all around and very questionable documentary-like CGI. Still a somewhat feel-good movie and worth a watch if you have some time to kill.",01-01-2024
Dogtooth,45,"(Spoliers) As is the case with most Yorgos films, more style than substance. No explanation is given as to the motivations of the parent’s strict upbringing of their children. It’s also not really clear why the Dad arranges sexual experiences for his son, who seems to partake in it more out of routine than his own pleasure, and it gets even stranger when these encounters become incestuous.",01-01-2024
Bernie,55,"Alright, but not a particularly spectacular story to be made into a movie.",01-01-2024
The Outfit,60,"Decent first half, but storyline becomes farfetched and overly-complicated.",01-01-2024
Deathproof,85,"A slowburner but very good nonetheless. One of the only films I've seen with realistic and easy-to-follow dialogue. Classic Tarantino themes of extreme gore and an obsession with feet.",01-01-2024
Jacob's Ladder,75,"A pretty good psychological thriller where we constantly question what is reality and whether we should believe and sympathise with Jacob’s claims. However, quite a disappointing and cliche ending where the various layers of the story that unfolded now all seem rather pointless.",01-01-2024
71,60,"Was excited to see another Jack O’Connell film after his impressive role in “Unbroken”, however here he was cast into a role involving very little dialogue or opportunities to deliver a notable performance. Decent overall, but was quite confused as to who was on what side. Some tense moments which seemed to lose momentum or end rather prematurely.",01-01-2024
The Black Phone,55,"Started relatively strong but soon got a bit ridiculous. Although this film is a horror and supernatural elements are to be expected, it felt like it didn’t actually need them and could have just played with the serial killer storyline. There was also no attempt at explaining the whole black phone situation.",01-01-2024
Jurassic World: Dominion,40,"Quite painful to watch. The same plot being recycled over and over again. This film’s only saving grace was that it seemed to have less CGI and more real-world models than the other Jurassic World films. This series really needs to end, it’s painful to know another one is on the way.",01-01-2024
Kiss The Girls,55,"Started decent but got a bit farfetched. Quite a predictable twist at the end too.",01-01-2024
Carrie,60,"Quite bizarre. It seemed most of the film was just a build up to an extreme finale. Was a bit confused with the ending and lack of resolution.",01-01-2024
Demolition Man,60,"Good use of sets rather than dated CGI. Wesley Snipes makes a great bad guy. Bit confused why references to John’s daughter are included in the plot yet no attempts to identify her are made.",01-01-2024
The World's Fastest Indian,60,"An easy watch and a feel-good film for all ages. There’s not many serious twists or turns however, and the constant repeating of questions due to Burt’s hearing problems quickly becomes infuriating.",01-01-2024
It Ends With Us,75,"A unique take on the Romance genre, with some deeper topics explored. Not without its fair share of cliche/cheesy moments though.",01-01-2024
Mulholland Drive,70,"Understood the overall storyline of the movie but there were lots of scenes and details that don’t really seem to have any explanation or relevance. The over-the-top, almost theatre-like, acting works well to give you the feeling something isn’t quite right.",01-01-2024
A History of Violence,60,"Had potential but the backstory and Tom’s past life wasn’t really explored at all.",01-01-2024
Legends of the Fall,50,"A strange and complicated love story. In the end we don’t have much respect for the two main protagonists, Tristan and Susannah, given their questionable behaviour and choices throughout.",01-01-2024
Alien: Romulus,80,"(SPOILERS) A strong addition to the series. The facehugger and chest-bursting scenes are staples to the series but can feel a bit repetitive after a while. The new alien creature and style of main characters added some originality to this instalment. Could have done with some more planetary locations, rather than all the action taking place on the spaceship.",01-01-2024
The Mule,70,"Decent, enjoyable performance from Clint Eastwood. Hard to believe Earl didn’t understand for so long what he was carrying. In the end we don’t feel any sympathy for Earl as its never really explained why he was absent in his families lives for so many years.",01-01-2024
Fatal Attraction,75,"An intense thriller with a believable and well executed plot. Great performances all round.",01-01-2024
The Thin Red Line,70,"Nice cinematography and realistic action scenes in this star-studded war film. The runtime could have been a lot shorter, with the middle half dragging on for quite a while. Also, the narration was a bit too abstract and didn’t make much sense.",01-01-2024
The Greatest Of All Time,50,"A farfetched plot and over the top action scenes, but as to be expected for any Tamil movie. Quite a unique storyline and twist, although the post-credits scene was a bit silly.",01-01-2024
Fracture,65,"(SPOILERS) The film revolves around an elaborate cover up of a murder, but in the end its all unraveled by some simple technicalities in the “Double Jeopardy” law, which is hard to believe Mr. Crawford overlooked. The cliffhanger ending leaves us beyond frustrated and makes the entire film seem a bit pointless. Poor performance from Rosamund Pike, but made up for by Gosling and Hopkins.",01-01-2024
Juno,70,"Decent, but Juno is quite intolerable and its hard to understand why Mark & Vanessa would trust her.",01-01-2024
Back To Black,70,"An insightful dive into the chaotic life of the late Amy Winehouse. While honouring her legacy and talents, the film also doesn’t shy away from showing her negative sides too.",01-01-2024
Sleepers,80,"A unique and interesting story. However, was expecting a plot twist or some drama caused by the love triangle.",01-01-2024
Money Monster,50,"(SPOILERS) Such a far fetched and unrealistic plot. Lee was essentially allowed to attempt market manipulation live on TV, without any repercussions, by asking viewers to invest in IBIS under the pretence that it might save his life, even though Kyle already expressed he wasn’t interested in the money. Infact, we’re frustratingly left not knowing Kyle’s full motivations for his acts for most of the movie, until he finally reveals he simply wanted an apology from Walt, which is just bizarre and child-like. The film tries to garner sympathy for Kyle in the end, although it fails to really do so as ultimately he made his own investment decisions and also almost kills a man unnecessarily.",30-09-2024
Will & Harper,40,"The odd touching moment, but otherwise pretty boring.",11-10-2024
Blink Twice,75,"(SPOLIERS) A gripping psychological thriller with well built-up suspense throughout. Not without some major plot holes and unanswered questions though. For example, why does the perfume only erase Jess from the other girls’ memories, yet they can perfectly remember eachother. Also it’s never explained why Slater was apologising at the start of the movie and what he had done.",13-10-2024
Step Up,60,"A feel-good and easy to watch film, albeit very cheesy and predictable. Impressive dancing all round.",13-10-2024
Woman of the Hour,75,"A commendable directorial debut from Anna Kendrick. Straight and to the point, with minimal unnecessary fluff. Could have done with a bit more backstory on Rodney, as reading up later revealed a lot of interesting history.",20-10-2024
Don’t Move,20,"Terrible plot. Terrible acting. Terrible script. Just truly terrible all round.",30-10-2024
Midsommar,65,"(SPOILERS) Didn’t quite live up to its potential. Very slow and drawn out, with too many parts that just don’t add up. Soon after arriving Dani is adamant she wants to leave, but then for some reason this is never shown again and she stays willingly. Dani has a bad trip from the mushroom tea, but then bizarrely decides to take it again (or some similar psycoactive drink) later for the May queen dance competition. A huge deal is made of the fact that Simon left for the train station without Connie, yet barely an eyelid is bat when both Mark and Josh disappear in the same day.",03-11-2024
Heretic,65,"(SPOILERS) Decent, but nothing special. Starts well, with lots of well-built tension, but soon loses momentum with drawn out monologues. Too much focus on the religious elements, where the psychopathic/serial-killer themes would have been more engaging. Hugh Grant excelled in what was a very different role to his norm.",07-11-2024
The Master,55,"This film lacks an engaging storyline or sense of direction. Nothing really happens and there’s several mind-numbingly boring sequences. Somewhat rescued by its beautiful cinematography and excellent performances all round.",10-11-2024
Inside Out 2,60,"Although this sequel adds some new characters and emotions to the mix, it’s not particularly imaginative, and the novelty of the concept has worn off a little.",01-01-2024
Challengers,60,"Decent in parts but there was no real resolution or reasoning about the plot. None of the 3 main characters are particularly likeable, especially Tashi. The background house music throughout was hard to take seriously and didn’t fit at all.",01-01-2024
A Quiet Place: Day One,40,"Nothing new or exciting with this instalment. A prequel that adds absolutely nothing to the back story. There’s no explanation of how it all began or what it was like in the early days, and instead the plot revolves around a sick girl. Also, a lot that doesn’t make sense, for example why is it fine to stand near a loud fountain, yet in most cases they’re not allowed to even whisper.",01-01-2024
Twisters,75,"Surprisingly good with plenty of action and tornados. Some impressive sets for mass destruction scenes. Obviously quite over-the-top and unrealistic, but fun nonetheless. Great soundtrack.",01-01-2024
Ready Or Not,45,"Obviously this movie isn’t supposed to be taken too seriously, with a blend of horror and comedic elements, however it’s pretty poor in both departments.",01-01-2024
Gifted,65,"A decent watch, but I did find myself questioning Frank’s decisions, and Mary wasn’t particularly likeable as a main character. Also a somewhat unconvincing ending.",01-01-2024
Lucy,40,"A good concept and started strong, but got quite ridiculous in the 2nd half. The portrayed human capabilities from increased cerebral capacity are far-fetched and quite frankly silly.",01-01-2024
The Devil All The Time,80,"An interesting intertwining of multiple storylines, with a common core theme of religious extremism. A fairly slow-burner but still engaging and all character’s stories are well resolved.",01-01-2024
We Grown Now,65,"Not bad, but nothing really happens. Some nice cinematic scenes. The characters difficult lives weren’t really delved into enough with several avenues left unexplored. For example, growing up without a father, or their financial struggles, so we weren’t fully able to empathise with them.",01-01-2024
Speak No Evil,85,"A unique and gripping thriller which keeps the viewer feeling uneasy throughout. An exceptional performance from James McAvoy really elevates this movie. The main characters have us pulling out our hair on several occasions with some seriously questionable decisions.",01-01-2024
Leave The World Behind,10,"Possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Full of side stories which have no bearing on the (non-existent) plot. The film felt like the first episode of a series, with no resolution after a dull and unnecessarily long 2hr 20 runtime. Dreadful script and, with the exception of Mahershala Ali, terrible acting all round.",01-01-2024
Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,30,"Not got many words for this one. Somehow even more over-the-top and ridiculous than expected. Kong's bionic arm was so unnecessary and takes this series to a comical level.",01-01-2024
Casino,80,"Another hit from Scorsese with an exceptional performance from Sharon Stone. Somewhat predictable and a bit slow in parts but a good watch nonetheless.",07-12-2024
Our Little Secret,20,"A silly and cheesy plot, coupled with absolutely appalling acting from all the cast, makes this movie painful to watch.",20-12-2024
Wicked,70,"Better than I was expecting. Good sets and performances. The songs can get a bit excessive though and caused some scenes to drag.",21-12-2024
Carry-On,45,"Unrealistic and not particularly tense. Can't take Jason Bateman seriously in the role of a villain and he's not remotely intimidating.",22-12-2024
Falling for Christmas,20,"Obviously just a light-hearted Christmas movie that shouldn't be taken too seriously, but still undeserving of a rating higher than this.",23-12-2024
Friday,45,"Was expecting this film to be a lot funnier than it was, but neither Chris Tucker nor Ice Cube delivered their usual levels of humour, partly due to the poor script but also their overacting of every single line.",29-12-2024
Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl,65,"Impressive stop-motion animation as always and great to see the return of Feathers McGraw, but not as funny as previous films.",30-12-2024
Sonic the Hedgehog 3,70,"Good to see Shadow join the series. Can't complain about twice the Jim Carrey.",31-12-2024
Aloha,25,"Literally no idea what this film was about. Not even remotely entertaining, despite the star-studded cast.",01-01-2025
Kramer vs. Kramer,75,"An engaging and emotional watch, although not much happens.",04-01-2025
The Substance,80,"A unique and audacious film which redefines the Horror genre. The film climaxes with complete chaos (reminiscent of 'Carrie'), which was borderline too much, but somewhat necessary given the fairly predictable beginning and middle of the movie. Superb cinematography comprising of close-ups and good use of colour. Absolutely exceptional work from the make-up/prosthetics team.",10-01-2025
The Mauritanian,60,"An insightful look into life inside Guantanamo Bay and the harsh reality of torture being used in modern day first-world countries. However, without any solid allibi or explanation given as to Mohamedou's associations with terrorist groups, we are plagued with doubts regarding his innocence and ultimately the viewer is left lacking much sympathy for him. An exceptional performance from the relatively unknown Tahar Rahim.",16-01-2025
The Bikeriders,70,"A decent watch but doesn't really have a substantial plot. The characters lack much depth or emotions, and seem to just blindly follow the club's leader without any clear motivations.",17-01-2025
Nosferatu,70,"The majority of this Gothic film is masterfully shot in dark, moonlit scenes, with the gray-scale imagery invoking an uneasy feeling aswell as perhaps paying homage to the black-and-white original. An excellent performance from the relatively unknown Lily-Rose Depp. However, the movie lacked creativity in the horror space, using cheap jump-scares on multiple occasions and taking heavy influence from films like The Exorcist with the arched-back, spasm-filled, possession sequences.",21-01-2025
Awake,50,"An original plot and a surprising twist, although poorly executed and dreadful acting.",23-01-2025
Cocaine Bear,60,"A silly plot with some laugh-out-loud moments, but not a top-tier comedy by any means. Good casting and performances.",23-01-2025
Mother's Instinct,70,"A surprisingly unknown film considering the 2 Oscar-winning actresses in lead roles. Pretty engaging and well built tension throughout, which at times had us questioning who to believe, but was let down by the final act which felt rushed and too farfetched.",24-01-2025
Doubt,65,"(SPOILERS) An engaging story and the title of the movie has deep themes throughout. The ending leaves the viewer to their own interpretation of Sister Aloysius' doubts; is she referring to the Father's guilt, her strength in her religion or her trust in the Church system? Personally, this was a disappointing ending as there's no real resolution. Exceptional performances all around, especially from Philip Seymour Hoffman.",26-01-2025
The Sapphires,55,"A promising storyline, but quite poorly executed, with an awkwardly unfunny script, poor acting, and shoddy CGI. The girls' bond and love for eachother is highly questionable as they all show selfishness and envy throughout the movie.",26-01-2025
The Brutalist,65,"Beautiful cinematography and musical score, but overall just quite underwhelming and I'm not entirely sure what the focus or theme of the film was supposed to be. Barely any attention is given to László's Jewish or Hungarian heritage, or any consequential hardships that could bring in 1950s America. Instead the viewer is left watching the fairly mundane life of an architect embarking on a new project.",27-01-2025
The Apprentice,75,"Sebastian Stan does a convincing job of playing the young, ruthless Donald Trump, with all his mannerisms executed to a tee without being too in-your-face about it. This biopic covers business and politics, love and loss, and everything in-between.",31-01-2025
A Man Called Otto,65,"A depressing yet feel-good movie. Too many unrealistic interactions between characters made the story feel a bit forced and unnatural.",07-02-2025
Portrait of a Lady on Fire,65,"A slow and 'artsy' kind of film, which started quite strong but soon lost momentum and interest. The intentional lack of music draws all of the viewer's attention to the vivid visuals, which were a joy to watch. The storyline is simple and unique, but needed more meaningful developments or a turn of events to have kept me engaged.",08-02-2025
A Real Pain,85,"A unique film which blends comedy with sombre undertones. The exceptional writing and performances helped to develop the characters in an authentic way. Despite Benji's erratic behaviour, we grow to empathise with him as we see his deeper emotions and understand his loneliness. The camera work and colour grading were exquisite and focused on the contrast of dull shots portrayed in a rich and vibrant manner.",15-02-2025
Conclave,70,"Surprisingly engaging despite the slow pace, although the ending felt a bit out-of-place and unrealistic. Exquisitely composed shots and accompanying soundtrack. Commendable performances all round, particularly from Ralph Fiennes.",21-02-2025
Beasts of No Nation,80,"A powerful and raw look into the lives of civilians caught in the middle of a civil war. We see the formation of a child soldier after being groomed by a group of rebels and their enigmatic leader. We sympathise with Agu, despite the atrocities he commits, as he shows guilt and awareness of the immorality of his actions. Rich visuals accompanied by an excellent soundtrack.",28-02-2025
Juror #2,75,"A unique and gripping plot. We find ourselves in a moral dilemma, contemplating what we would do if we were in Justin's situation. I found myself constantly wondering how the movie will conclude, and in the end it was executed quite well, although I felt it could have benefited from a bit of a twist. ",01-03-2025
I'm Still Here,40,"What started as quite promising soon dissolved into absolute nothingness. An extremely slow-burner with very little development. We never find out what Reuben's role was as a congressman, why he and his family were detained, or what caused the country's political unrest. While I understand the movie is from his wife's point of view and how she was left in the dark as to Reuben's well-being, it's hard to engage emotionally with them as we see such little of what went on in the jail, nor do we know any of their back stories. Eunice seemingly goes back to a relatively normal life with her children after Reuben's disappearance, visiting ice cream shops and swimming in the sea, and we don't get a sense of desperation to find her husband. 
Just when some tension starts to build in some scenes it's then released immediately with no consequence. Are the men at the house going to hurt the family? No, they're playing table football with them. Is Eunice going to go through some suffering and torture in the jail? No, she's released in perfect health. Is something bad going to happen to Veroca in London? No, she returns safe and sound. While the kidnapping of a father is certainly a tragic story, the rest of it just isn't interesting enough to be adapted into a feature-length film. 
There's only so far some nice golden hour shots and great performances can salvage this movie. The cherry on the cake was a fake scene at the end to trick us into watching the credits.",05-03-2025
Escape from Pretoria,75,"A gripping prison-break thriller packed with tension. It's hard to believe the ingenuity of the escapees in this true story. Could have shown a bit more brutality from the guards to heighten the risks of being caught even more.",06-03-2025
Anora,80,"A raw and open look into the life of a sex worker tangled in an unexpected situationship disguised as true love. A truly chaotic, yet brilliant, middle section brought intensity with a touch of comedy. An excellent script with realistic dialogue and impressive performances all round really elevated this movie.",14-03-2025
Mickey 17,55,"Started very promising with an interesting idea (albeit the underlying human-cloning concept is far from unique), but the latter half began to lose the plot and felt all over the place. The film lost focus of Mickey and his 'multiple' situation and became engrossed in a dull sub-plot revolving around colonization. While the comedic elements were enjoyable in parts, it became overdone and detracted from the more serious ethical and political undertones. 
Robert Pattinson's exaggerated American accent was hard to take seriously, nor was it necessary whatsoever given the crew's range of accents. The characters and their development were parodic at best, with Mark Ruffalo's Trump resemblance being far too in your face. 
Overall, the film was a strange mish-mash of genres and themes, failing to establish itself strongly in any category.",19-03-2025
Weekend at Bernie's,75,"A ridiculous plot filled with lots of laughs. A good blend of slapstick and dark comedy.",21-03-2025
X,55,"The classic recipe for a slasher but with nothing new brought to the table and overall just quite underwhelming. Most of the character's were unlikeable and some of their developments were odd and unnecessary, particularly Lorraine's. Pearl and Howard's motives weren't very apparent, and while I suspect this will be delved into deeper in the prequel, it resulted in this film not really working as a standalone installment.",30-03-2025
Kinds of Kindness,50,"Yorgos just put the final nail in his coffin for me. As is the case with most of his movies, overly indulgent and a case of style over substance. Three bizarre storylines where things were happening but there was no cohesion or sense to any of the plots. Rescued somewhat by the nice visuals and colour-grading.",04-04-2025
Sicario,65,"Epic soundtrack and cinematography, as expected from the Villeneuve and Deakins combo. Some great and intense scenes, but these were few and far between and overall the pacing was quite slow, leaving me wanting more. Some characters and dialogue felt a bit unnecessary and out of place.",05-04-2025
Companion,55,"A predictable plot with an interesting mix of thriller and comedy elements.",11-04-2025
Escape from Alcatraz,75,"An incredible true story of an escape from what was regarded as the world's most secure prison. The fear and consequences of being caught could have been raised further by showing more brutality from the prison guards. Would have liked to find out more about the backstories of the main characters and why they were in prison in the first place.",21-04-2025
Uncut Gems,70,"This movie depicts the hectic life of (fictional) Howard Ratner who continuously makes poor decisions and gains a lot of enemies along the way. An engaging storyline, although I didn't feel much fear towards the main debt collectors as they didn't show a lot of intimidation or violence towards Howard. There's a lot of chaotic dialogue with people talking over eachother, which is jarring at first but actually makes the characters feel more realistic. The 80s synthwave soundtrack doesn't really fit with the modern day New York setting.",27-04-2025
Warfare,80,"Refreshing to see a war movie which feels authentic and not Hollywoodized. The very slow start actually heightened the tension as we knew something was coming but didn't know when. Probably the most immersive and intense audio I've ever heard, with bass that rattled my brain. The gun shooting scenes had room for improvement, as often the soldier's seemed to aim randomly and we weren't shown their targets or if any bullets were even hitting.",01-05-2025
Sinners,70,"An interesting and unique blend of themes, mixing race, religion, music and vampires. Could have done with more backstory on the vampires, such as where they came from and what their motivations are; are they racially-driven like the Klan?",03-05-2025
The Help,70,"An insight into the world of black maids ('help') working in white households in 1960s America and the challenges that they faced. A good mix of serious themes and light-hearted humour too.",09-05-2025
"I, Tonya",80,"A sad true story about the controversial career of a talented young ice-skater, retold in a documentary-style manner. A sprinkling of comedy and breaking of the fourth-wall make this an engaging and unique biopic.",16-05-2025
Life or Something Like It,45,"Lots of underdeveloped subplots and parts of the storyline which don't feel properly resolved. For example, how was Prophet Jack able to make his extremely accurate predictions, was it some supernatural gift or just coincidence. Angelina Jolie's performance is very cringe, with her constantly trying to be cute/sexy in every single scene, including even the more serious moments. The script, scene transitions and soundtrack were all a bit over the place.",21-05-2025
Falling Down,80,"A brilliantly chaotic yet simple storyline as we watch a man slowly lose his sanity while he attempts to get home for his daughter's birthday. Michael Douglas does a convincing job of playing the psychotic protagonist and ultimately leaves the viewer unsure whether to feel sympathy or disgust towards his character.",22-05-2025
The Florida Project,60,"An uncomfortable watch as we witness the lives of some of America's lower class families living in a motel just outside Disneyland. None of the characters, except Bobby, were even remotely likeable, and this coupled with the poor parenting made it difficult as a viewer to emphasise with any of them. The performances were great, but the overall lack of storyline and development really brought this film down for me.",23-05-2025
Final Destination: Bloodlines,65,"A decent addition to the series, with a slightly unique take on the classic formula. Lots of teasing of tension and insanely gory deaths, even for Final Destination standards, but too much shoddy CGI and acting for my liking.",25-05-2025
The Good Son,60,"An interesting and different role for Macaulay Culkin, and one he plays surprisingly well. The storyline had potential but the delivery lacked intensity or any nail-biting suspense. More of a melodrama than a convincing psychological drama. Some impressive real-world shots instead of using green screens or dated CGI, such as the highway and ice-skating incidents.",31-05-2025
Leave No Trace,30,"Extremely underwhelming. This movie attempts to have a deep storyline with some poignant underlying themes, such as PTSD and separation, but none of these hit particularly hard for various reasons. The protagonists choose to live in the woods, rather than this being the direct result of some misfortune. They attempt to live off the grid and to 'leave no trace', but it's hypocritical that they still make use of modern conveniences like propane and visiting a supermarket when supplies are low. The character's emotional distance and lack of gratitude towards strangers who offer help aims for realism but instead makes them unlikeable and difficult to connect with as a viewer. We're aware Will is a Veteran and likely suffered trauma with lasting effects, but this is barely delved into, nor is the absence of Tom's mother, which makes it impossible to empathise with them to any degree.",06-06-2025
Copycat,55,"What started as a decent thriller soon spiralled into a cliché 90s cop action movie. Unnecessary romance subplots and melodramatic characters drain the tension, while the killer's motives are left mostly unexplained.",18-06-2025
No Hard Feelings,55,"A few genuinely funny moments, but overall felt underwhelming. The story involves too many implausible character choices and plot developments, which makes it hard to stay emotionally invested. A light comedy that doesn’t quite land.",20-06-2025
Us,40,"A nonsensical plot and not particularly scary. An unnecessary twist at the end leaves too many unanswered questions to be effective. The film makes contrived attempts at deeper symbolism - involving white rabbits and 'Hands Across America' - that feel more superficial than meaningful. A few well-composed shots and Lupita Nyong'o's commited performance saved this movie from an even lower rating.",21-06-2025
The Witch,40,"For a film called The Witch, there wasn't a lot of witching. What begins with promise slowly turns into a moody family drama with only a touch of supernatural horror. The suspense is minimal, and the heavy period dialect makes the dialogue difficult to follow, making it hard to fully engage with the story. Ultimately, more atmosphere than substance.",26-06-2025
F1,60,"(SPOILERS) I had high hopes for this one, but it ultimately fell flat. The cinematography and camera work were immersive, and accompanied by a nice modern soundtrack. The cameos were fun, and the integration with real Grand Prix weekends was seamless.
However, I expected more realism given Lewis Hamilton’s role as producer. Instead, we get a lead driver who intentionally causes collisions to trigger yellow flags, repeatedly disobeys team orders, and dates the team's Technical Director—all without any real consequences.
The relationship between the APXGP drivers is inconsistent: one moment they're causing a double DNF out of fierce competitiveness, the next they're sacrificing their races for each other.
Unfortunately, the film falls into the classic Hollywood formulas, complete with an unnecessary romance subplot and a cartoonish villain aiming to take over the team.",03-07-2025
The Abyss,40,"Visually ambitious and a unique take on the Sci-Fi genre with its underwater setting. However, the plot felt muddled and failed to keep me engaged. I didn't really understand the characters or the film’s core message, which left me more confused than impressed.",05-07-2025
Memories of Murder,75,"(SPOILERS) A gripping look into the lives of detectives investigating a series of murders within a unit plagued by coercion and corruption. The unresolved ending was frustrating, as without finding the killer there's no closure or understanding of their motive. But perhaps that’s the point: it mirrors the detectives’ own experience, constantly left in the dark and haunted by uncertainty.",11-07-2025
Gran Turismo,70,"A pretty decent racing movie, with some surprisingly emotional scenes. While it has its fair share of cheesy moments and cliché characters, the unique integration of video game elements and some impressive crash sequences resulted in this film beating expectations.",12-07-2025
We Live In Time,75,"Surprisingly good for a Romance. While the core plot leans on familiar themes, the way it was told with a non-chronological timeline added a layer of intrigue and kept the viewer trying to piece together the story. The ending felt slightly rushed, but strong performances from Pugh and Garfield elevate this film.",13-07-2025
